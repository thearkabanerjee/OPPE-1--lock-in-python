# escape characters are explained here

print ('hello world')

print ("it's a beautiful day")

# another way 

print ('it\'s a beautiful day')

# this works somehow


print('my name is arka. i am coding right now ')
# additional space 


print ('my name is arka. \t i am coding right now')


# \t acts as a tab

# more space ?

print ('my name is arka. \t \t i am coding right now')

# different lines

print ('hello arka. \n banerjee is calling you')


# these work btw
print ("it's a beautiful day")
