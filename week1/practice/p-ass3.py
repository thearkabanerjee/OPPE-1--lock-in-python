# strings and slicing

# somehow very important for my preparation

# Solve all the below tasks related to indexing and slicing.

# Keep in mind 🧠 The concept of indexing and slicing will come again in later weeks with list and tuple which are also sequences like string.

# This exercise gives you practice in different indexing and slicing methods.

# Problem Type: Input variable - Output Variable, Hidden suffix for evaluation


# Sample inputs (# note: The values given in the prefix code(grey) will be changed by the autograder according to the testcase while running them.

s = "hello pyhton"
course_code = "24t2cs1002" # 24 - year, t2 - term 2, cs1002 - course id
# <eoi>




output1 = s[2] # str: get the third character of s

output2 = s[-4] # str: get the fourth last character of s

output3 = ... # str: get the first 3 characters of s

output4 = ... # str: get every second character of s

output5 = ... # str: get the last 3 characters of s

output6 = ... # str: get the reverse of s

course_term = ... # int: get the term of the year as number from course_code
course_year = ... # int: get the year as two digit number from course_code


print (output1 , output2, output3, output4, output5, output6,course_term, course_year)
