# Solve all the below tasks related to relational and logical operators.

# This exercise gives you practice in building up boolean expressions.

# Problem Type: Input variable - Output Variable, Hidden suffix for evaluation



# Sample inputs (# note: The values given in the prefix code(grey) will be changed by the autograder according to the testcase while running them.
a = 5

price1, discount1 = 100, 20 # for offer1
price2, discount2 = 120, 10 # for offer2

# Assume discount is given in percentages

# <eoi>


output1 = (a >= 5) # bool: True if a greater than or equal to 5

output2 = (a % 5 == 0) # bool: True if a is divisible by 5

output3 = (a % 2 != 0 and a < 10) # bool: True if a is odd number less than 10

output4 = (a % 2 != 0 and -10 <a <10) # bool: True if a is an odd number within the range -10 and 10

output5 = (len(str(a)) <= 10 and len (str(a)) %2 ==0) # bool: True if a has even number of digits but not more than 10 digits

is_offer1_cheaper = (((discount1/100)* price1) > ((discount2/100)* price2))# bool: True if the offer1 is strictly cheaper
