# programming assignment 1 for week 1 


# Solve the below tasks related to Numbers.

# Tasks 1 to 3 - building up Arithemetic expression
# Tasks 4 and 5 - floating point arithemetic
# Tasks 6 and 7 - modulo and floor division
# Problem Type: Input variable - Output Variable, Hidden suffix for evaluation


# template code

# output1 = ... # int: sum of a and b
# output2 = ... # int: twice the sum of a and b
# output3 = ... # int: absolute difference between a and b
# output4 = ... # int: absolute difference between sum and product of a and b

# # Find discounted price given price and discount_percent
# # input variables : price: int, discount_percent: float
# discounted_price = ... # float

# # Round the discounted_price
# rounded_discounted_price = ... # int

# # Find hrs and mins given the total_mins
# # input variables : total_mins
# hrs = ... # int: hint: think about floor division operator
# mins = ... # int
